This is the problem with latest eclipse to prevent bloating. 
So go to Eclipse-> Help--> Install New software 
and --> type Oxygen in the "Work with" space 
(or copy paste this "Oxygen - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen".)

Now search "Market place client" in the second search box .

You will get as below: General purpose tools-->Market place client. 
Check that box and you are good to go.
