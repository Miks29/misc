Issue Description
When attempting to install the Jaspersoft Studio as a plugin (community version only) for Eclipse, 
either via Eclipse Marketplace or "Install software", there are occassional errors indicating that 
update files or links are missing.   The problems are caused by intermittent hosting issues on sourceforge. 

Resolution
As a workaround you can try to install the plugin using the zipped solution we started providing in 6.3.1 version. 

Download "full-site.zip" from the link above to a local drive, 
then in Eclipse choose Help > Install New Software... > Add (button), 
then hit Archive on the following pop-up and choose the full-site.zip which you downloaded, 
then explore and follow prompts.
